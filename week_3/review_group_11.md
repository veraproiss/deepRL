# Review HW2 from group 11 by group 4
## Meta
- repository is a bit unstructured -> what are the relevant files?

## Gridworld
- everything is working and readable code
- your todos would be nice to haves
- a space or a '_' might be better to visualize empty fields
- to reach perfection it could use some refactoring (move() is to long/redundant, reward shouldn't be a self-variable...)

## Sarsa
- only one remark: you update the q-table every n steps. Wouldn't it be more efficient and precise to simulate an episode completely and then update for each step?

## main.py
- well structured and commented
- nice touch to show the learned result at the end
